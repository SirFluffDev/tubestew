> An automatic content creation system.  

This project aims to completely automate the process of running a YouTube channel; videos and all.

## Goals  
- Generate videos to upload in a variety of formats
  - Both shorts and full videos
- Write interesting scripts
  - Pull from reddit posts
  - Write with ChatGPT
- Automatically upload to YouTube

## Why?
I'm interested in creating content, but I don't want to invest all my time into it. Automating the process still allows me to have creative input, without sacrificing all of my precious free time. Plus, I love automating things. I know people have made similar things before (all of the reddit story youtube bots), but I wanted to take a stab at it myself.  
  
I'll get to tell all my friends I made it, too.

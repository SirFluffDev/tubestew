# /assets/music
This is where your music files should go.  
I find that it helps to categorize music by artist.  
For example, I'll put all of my music from Lakey Inspired (great free music artist by the way) in './assets/music/Lakey Inspired'.  
It makes it a lot easier to automatically sort and choose music.

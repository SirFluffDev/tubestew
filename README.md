> An automatic content creation system.  

This project aims to completely automate the process of running a YouTube channel; videos and everything.

## Goals  
- Generate videos to upload in a variety of formats
  - Both shorts and full videos
- Write interesting scripts
  - Pull from reddit posts
  - Write with ChatGPT
- Automatically upload to YouTube (and other platforms in the future)

## Progress
- [ ] Video generation
  - [ ] Short form
  - [ ] Long form
- [ ] Automatic uploads
- [ ] Nice Interface

## Why?
I'm interested in creating content, but I don't want to invest all my time into it. Automating the process still allows me to have creative input, without sacrificing all of my precious free time. Plus, I love automating things. I'd like to be able to run this on a raspberry PI once it gets to a decent point. Have my own little content machine.  
  
I know people have made similar things before (all of the reddit story youtube bots), but I wanted to take a stab at it myself. Plus I'll get to tell everybody I made it, too.
  
If you're curious about the name, I was originally going to call it ChannelBrew - a name suggested by ChatGPT. I liked it, so I asked it for variations. This was one of them. It was too funny for me to pass up, so I kept it.
